exact-cover
===========

Exact cover solver in racket

Current implementation uses the dancing link algorithm to solve instances of the exact cover problem.

The interface uses a fair amount of abstraction which hurts performance somewhat. 

TODO: For someone reason the implementation slows down a lot when the instances become big. I do not know why.
